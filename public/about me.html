    I am a chearfull person, sociable, communicative, great team worker.
    
    Iâ€™m interested in becoming a Web Developer, Network engineer, and Python programmer.
    The IT world is something that has fascinated me since I was a child. 
    I always was repairing and installing friends computers.
    I don't think I like just something in particular in IT, I'll like to know all that IT has to do with
    I`m always ready to learn something new.
    I think my start would be in a position of Junior / Entry-level, can't wait to grow from there.
     Thank you! God bless you all!
