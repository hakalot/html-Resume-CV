    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>I’m interested in becoming a Web Developer, Network engineer, and Python programmer.</p>
    <p>The IT world is something that has fascinated me since I was a child. I always was repairing and installing friends computers. I don't think I like just something in particular in IT, I'll like to know all that IT has to do with, I`m always ready to learn something new.

        I think my start would be in a position of Junior / Entry-level, can't wait to grow from there.
        
        Thank you! God bless you all!</p>
